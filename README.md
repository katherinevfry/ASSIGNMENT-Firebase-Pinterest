- search pins. Quickly find that pin you saved about a coffee shop, or that cute outfit, or...whatever! Just type in a keyword and let that pin find you.
- explore. See what pins other users of Practically Pinterest have made available! Gather inspiration for your own boards.
- delete. Change your mind about going on the diet? Want to get rid of all those healthy recipies you pinned? When you delete a board, all the associated pins will delete as well.
- enjoy the simple UI. The simple and straightforward user interfaces puts the emphasis on what the user is creating.
